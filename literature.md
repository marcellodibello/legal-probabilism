# False convictions

John Morgan, [The Impact of False or Misleading Forensic Evidence on Wrongful Convictions](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/impact-false-or-misleading-forensic-evidence-wrongful-convictions)

> Long and detailed article by a forensic scientist on the causes of false convictions associated with bad forensic science. Used National Registry of Exoneration.
> Cautions against broad generalizations of forensic science as "junk science". Key contributions: (1) develops a typology and coding for types of error;
> (2) shows that many errors are due to (a) outdated standards (no longer used), (b) experts not part of official institutions and
> (c) testimony errors (incorrect presentation of otherwise correct forensic results). Wealth of information in the report. To be read very carefully.

> Updated version of the book, with more recent data. From the abstract: "high percentages of cases involve eyewitness misidentifications (70%) and forensics (69%). Most striking, more of the cases include false confessions (21%) and informant testimony (22%).

[The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis: Drivers of Prediction Accuracy in World Politics](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xap-0000040.pdf)

Article on intelligence analysis and intelligence predictions. Are expert accurate in their predictions? What qualities or methods used by experts are more accurate?

Tetlock & Gardner (2015), [Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction.]

> TBR. From the abstract: "good forecasting ... involves gathering evidence from a variety of sources, thinking probabilistically, working in teams, keeping score, and being willing to admit error and change course. We also suggest that the public accountability of participants ... boosted performance."

Wilcox & Mandel, [Critical Review of the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses Technique: Lessons for the Intelligence Community]()

> Article showing how the method known as Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) does not lead to good predictions in intelligence analysis. One of the culprits is the odd assessment of the probability of hypotheses in which only inconsitency with the evidence counts against the hypothesis, but not confirmation.
