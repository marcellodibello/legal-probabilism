## Articles and books

John Morgan, [The Impact of False or Misleading Forensic Evidence on Wrongful Convictions](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/impact-false-or-misleading-forensic-evidence-wrongful-convictions)

> Long and detailed article by a forensic scientist on the causes of false convictions associated with bad forensic science. Used National Registry of Exoneration.
> Cautions against broad generalizations of forensic science as "junk science". Key contributions: (1) develops a typology and coding for types of error;
> (2) shows that many errors are due to (a) outdated standards (no longer used), (b) experts not part of official institutions and
> (c) testimony errors (incorrect presentation of otherwise correct forensic results). Wealth of information in the report. To be read very carefully.

> Book on false convictions based only on DNA exonerations.

Garrett (2015) [Convicting the Innocent Redux](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2638472)

> Updated version of the book, with more recent data. From the abstract: "high percentages of cases involve eyewitness misidentifications (70%) and forensics (69%). Most striking, more of the cases include false confessions (21%) and informant testimony (22%).

## Spain

[Jose Antonio Valdivielso](https://www.registryofexonerations.eu/case_details/jose-antonio-valdivielso-attempted-murdermanslaughter-2002/)

(2021) [Jorge Casaleiro](https://www.registryofexonerations.eu/case_details/jorge-casaleiro-robberyburglary-2017/)

> Both these cases are similar. The defendant is convicted on the basis of eyewitness evidence. DNA evidence comes in late after the trials has been completed because of delays in the forensic reporting (unclear why). When the DNA report comes int, there is no match between the defendant and the crime sample. Defendant is exonerated. Why did it take so long for DNA report to come in?

> COMMENT: Both cases are cases of MISSING or INCOMPLETE evidence. It is puzzling that the trial went ahead even while knowing that the DNA report was missing.
>  Perhaps one question is this: when should one wait for more evidence to come in and hold off judgment, and when it is okay to go ahead even knowing that some evidence is missing? If the eyewitness testimony was strong enough, why should one wait for the DNA report to come in really?

> COUNTERFACTUALS and CAUSES: false conviction could have been avoided under a number of circumstances: (X1) If the expert forensic report had come in time; (X2) If the decision rule was "no conviction with uncorroborated eyewitness testimony"; (X3) if the decision rule was "no conviction with missing evidence" (more specifically, "no conviction if the decision-makers know of missing evidence (like DNA match) that would have changed the balance of the evdence"); variations of the above. So X1, X2 and X3 (and variations thereof) are all CAUSES of false convictions.

> The causality question is overdetermined. We do not need sophisticated statistical analyses to draw these conclusions about X1, X2 and X3 being causes of the false convictions. Just a detailed knowledge of the case is enough. The question is to what extent these causes generalize, whether they can guide policy changes, etc.

> EX ANTE / EX POST: Could the error have been avoided given what the decision-makers knew at the time? If the cause of the false conviction is missing evidence, but the decision-makers did not know about the missing evidence, the error could NOT have been (reasonably?) avoided.  Focus on (reasonably?) AVOIDABLE errors. 

# Eyewitness Evidence

## Types of Line-ups and which is more accurate

Worth examining these two issues: (a) sequential versus side-by-side lineups and (B) bliding, as two factors that improve accuracy in eyewitness identification:

> "Presenting suspects to witnesses sequentially rather than side by side reduces the tendency of witnesses to make relative judgments, which often are inaccurate. The double-blind aspect, under which the investigator administering the identification procedure does not know who the suspect is, reduces the possibility that witnesses will be improperly influenced to choose a particular individual."

# Non probabilistic evidence assessment and decision-making

Anderson (1981), [Legal Judgment as Information integration, Chapter 4](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/_files/norman-anderson-book/Chapter%204.pdf)

> I believe from the 1981 book *Foundations of information integration theory* by Norman Henry Anderson.

# How to improve accuracy of assessments, predictions and decisions

Tetlock & others (2015), [The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis: Drivers of Prediction Accuracy in World Politics](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xap-0000040.pdf)

> TBR. Article on intelligence analysis and intelligence predictions. Are expert accurate in their predictions? What qualities or methods used by experts are more accurate? The performance of experts is compared via tournaments. Some experts outperform others consistently. Key distinguishing characteristics are identified. 

> COMMENT: Brier score is used to assess accuracy, but we know that simply by using probabilities, all else being equal, an expert will outfperform others. So is the Brier score the right measure of accuracy? 

Tetlock & Gardner (2015), [Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction.]()

> TBR. From the abstract: "good forecasting ... involves gathering evidence from a variety of sources, thinking probabilistically, working in teams, keeping score, and being willing to admit error and change course. We also suggest that the public accountability of participants ... boosted performance."

Wilcox & Mandel, [Critical Review of the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses Technique: Lessons for the Intelligence Community]()

> Article showing how the method known as Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) does not lead to good predictions in intelligence analysis. One of the culprits is the odd assessment of the probability of hypotheses in which only inconsitency with the evidence counts against the hypothesis, but not confirmation. According to ACH, first, competing hypotheses and items of evidence must be listed, and then second, hypotheses are scored by counting how many items of evidence they are inconsistent with. The greater the number of inconsistencies for a hypothesis, the lower the probability of the hypothesis.

> COMMENT: This does not seem to work for intelligence analysis because you have a lot of false negatives. But does it work for criminal trials where the key is to avoid convicting the innocent?
