# False convictions

John Morgan, [The Impact of False or Misleading Forensic Evidence on Wrongful Convictions](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/impact-false-or-misleading-forensic-evidence-wrongful-convictions)

> Long and detailed article by a forensic scientist on the causes of false convictions associated with bad forensic science. Used National Registry of Exoneration.
> Cautions against broad generalizations of forensic science as "junk science". Key contributions: (1) develops a typology and coding for types of error;
> (2) shows that many errors are due to (a) outdated standards (no longer used), (b) experts not part of official institutions and
> (c) testimony errors (incorrect presentation of otherwise correct forensic results). Wealth of information in the report. To be read very carefully.
